# Good Strategy Bad Strategy - Framework Summary

**Source:** Richard Rumelt, "Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters"
**Created:** 2025-10-24
**Purpose:** Framework for developing Tailscale H1FY27 Product Strategy

## Key Themes from "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"

### The Strategy Kernel (Core Framework)

Rumelt argues that all good strategy contains three essential elements:

1. **Diagnosis**: Simplifies complex reality by identifying the critical challenge. It's not just describing the situation—it's pinpointing what makes it difficult.

2. **Guiding Policy**: An overall approach to overcome the challenge. Acts like "guardrails on a highway"—provides direction without prescribing every action.

3. **Coherent Actions**: Coordinated steps that reinforce each other. Actions aren't implementation details—they're the "punch" of your strategy.

### Four Hallmarks of Bad Strategy (Avoid These)

1. **Fluff**: Jargon and buzzwords masking weak thinking
2. **Failure to Face the Challenge**: Not identifying what actually makes the situation difficult
3. **Mistaking Goals for Strategy**: "We want to be #1" isn't strategy—it's an aspiration without a plan
4. **Bad Strategic Objectives**: Long lists of "things to do" that create silos instead of coherence

### Critical Insights

- **Strategy requires saying "No"**: If everyone loves your strategy, it's probably too weak. Real strategy involves tough choices and resource prioritization.
- **Focus creates power**: Concentrating resources on critical objectives beats spreading them thin
- **Leverage matters**: Apply strength against weakness—find where small actions create disproportionate results
- **Proximate objectives win**: Choose feasible near-term targets within reach, not just distant aspirations

## Seven Sources of Strategic Power

1. **Leverage**: Exploiting imbalances for disproportionate returns; concentrating effort on critical objectives
2. **Proximate Objectives**: Choosing feasible near-term targets within reach (like Apollo 11)
3. **Chain-Link Systems**: Designing interdependent processes competitors can't easily replicate (IKEA model)
4. **Design**: Creating coherence where "pieces work as a coherent whole"
5. **Focus**: Dominating specific market segments rather than serving everyone poorly
6. **Growth**: The *result* of successful strategy, never strategy itself
7. **Using Advantage**: Exploiting relative strengths and competitors' weaknesses through isolating mechanisms (patents, reputation, network effects)

Additional concepts: **Dynamics** (industry waves), **Inertia** (competitor inflexibility), **Entropy** (organizational decay)

## Recommendations for Tailscale Product Strategy

### 1. Start with Rigorous Diagnosis

**What to do:**
- Identify Tailscale's **core challenge**, not just opportunities. What specific obstacle is preventing the next level of success?
- Look at the competitive landscape, market dynamics, and internal constraints
- Use the materials in your `TailScale/Research/` folder (EPD Q4 plan, strategy notes) to identify patterns

**Questions to answer:**
- What makes this moment particularly challenging or important?
- What's changing in the market that requires strategic response?
- Where are we strong vs. weak relative to competitors?
- What customer problems remain unsolved?

**Avoid:** Generic statements like "rapidly evolving market" or "increasing competition." Be specific about *why* it's difficult.

### 2. Develop a Clear Guiding Policy

**What to do:**
- Based on your diagnosis, choose **one primary approach** for H1FY27
- Frame it as a method of dealing with the challenge, not a goal
- Ensure it provides direction while leaving room for tactical flexibility

**Examples of good guiding policy formats:**
- "Dominate the [specific segment] market before expanding horizontally"
- "Build developer loyalty through superior [specific capability]"
- "Leverage our [strength] to neutralize competitors' [advantage]"

**Avoid:**
- Lists of initiatives without a unifying theme
- Goals disguised as strategy ("Grow revenue by 40%")
- Trying to pursue multiple conflicting approaches simultaneously

### 3. Define Coherent Actions (The Hard Part)

**What to do:**
- List **5-7 specific actions** that coordinate to execute your guiding policy
- Ensure each action reinforces the others—not independent pet projects
- Make them feasible and within reach (proximate objectives)
- Be willing to explicitly say what you **won't** do

**Test for coherence:**
- Can you explain how each action supports the diagnosis and guiding policy?
- Do the actions work together or compete for resources?
- Would removing one action weaken the others?

**Avoid:**
- OKR lists that create silos ("Engineering will do X, Sales will do Y")
- "Dog's dinner" objectives that try to keep everyone happy
- Actions so ambitious they're as hard as the original challenge

### 4. Apply Strategic Leverage

**Look for:**
- Where can small investments create outsized returns?
- What customer segments could you dominate rather than just serve?
- What capabilities does Tailscale have that are hard to replicate?
- Where are competitors vulnerable or inflexible?

### 5. Red Flags to Watch For

As you develop the strategy, **immediately question** if you see:
- Universal buy-in (means you're not making tough choices)
- Long lists of priorities (means you're not prioritizing)
- Template-style "vision/mission/values" without substance
- Blue-sky objectives that ignore implementation obstacles
- Strategies that could apply to any company in your space

## Practical Next Steps for Your TailScale Work

1. **Review your research materials** through the diagnosis lens:
   - Re-read the H1FY27 strategy notes looking for the core challenge
   - Analyze the Q4 plan to understand what obstacles the team is facing
   - Identify what the EPD newsletter reveals about team focus

2. **Draft a one-page strategy** with:
   - 2-3 paragraphs on diagnosis
   - 1 paragraph on guiding policy
   - Bulleted list of 5-7 coherent actions
   - Explicit "what we won't do" section

3. **Test for quality**:
   - Can someone unfamiliar with Tailscale understand the challenge?
   - Does the guiding policy clearly flow from the diagnosis?
   - Do the actions genuinely coordinate, or could they exist independently?
   - Have you made choices that some stakeholders will disagree with?

## Final Thought

Rumelt emphasizes that **strategy is problem-solving, not goal-setting**. Your Tailscale product strategy should clearly articulate what makes the situation difficult, propose a coherent approach to overcome that difficulty, and specify coordinated actions that work together to execute that approach.

The mark of good strategy is often simplicity and obviousness *in hindsight*—but getting there requires hard diagnostic work upfront.

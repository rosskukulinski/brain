# Summary

Avery Pennarun's conversation with Ben Thompson for Stratechery, tracing Tailscale's origin story through Avery's networking journey.

**Early Inspiration**: Avery's networking journey began with practical sibling rivalry—sharing a single modem. This teenage problem-solving led to writing Linux drivers for obsolete network cards, discovering a knack for networking infrastructure.

**First Venture: Net Integration Technologies**: At university, built dial-up sharing appliances for small offices. The company's "plug-and-play, zero tech support" approach proved so successful it attracted IBM's acquisition—teaching that ease-of-use is strategic, especially when users lack technical expertise.

**The Google Perspective**: Working at Google revealed a crucial insight: most organizations don't need Google-scale infrastructure. This realization shaped Tailscale's philosophy—solving widespread small problems rather than pursuing massive scale.

**Tailscale's Birth**: A Canadian bank colleague presented the spark: securing server access without extensive rewrites. Avery created the tool he couldn't find elsewhere. A blog post launched Tailscale onto Hacker News' front page, with overwhelming user interest confirming product-market fit.

**Vision Realized**: Today, Tailscale enables seamless peer-to-peer networking across millions of devices. As one customer noted, it "makes the Internet work the way I thought it worked… until I learned how it actually worked."

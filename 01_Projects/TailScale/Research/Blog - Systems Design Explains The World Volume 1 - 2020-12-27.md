# Summary

This influential essay explores recurring architectural patterns across disciplines—from software engineering to organizational structures to markets. Pennarun examines four major archetypes:

**Centralization vs. Decentralization**: Challenges the assumption that flat, distributed systems are always superior. Drawing on Jo Freeman's work, notes that "apparent lack of structure too often disguised an informal, unacknowledged and unaccountable leadership." Real-world systems contain hidden centralized control points—make them explicit so they can be debugged.

**Chicken-and-Egg Problems**: Products whose value depends on widespread adoption face a catch-22. Examples: social networks, IPv6, gaming consoles, app stores. Successful solutions lower adoption costs and deliver value even with fewer users (Nintendo's exclusive launch titles, backward compatibility).

**Second-System Effect**: Rewriting systems from scratch typically fails. Pattern repeats across IPv6, Python 3, major rewrites: projects take longer than expected, introduce new problems, split resources. Recommendation: refactor incrementally rather than replace wholesale.

**Innovator's Dilemma**: Established companies optimize for margin-rich products, allowing low-cost competitors to improve gradually until dominant. Intel vs. ARM demonstrates this—incumbents retreat upmarket until disruptors become superior. This structural trap is rarely escapable for large organizations.

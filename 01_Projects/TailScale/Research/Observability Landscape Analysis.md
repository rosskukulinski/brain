# Observability Landscape Analysis

*How Tailscale customers monitor their tailnets vs legacy VPN and modern cloud networking approaches*

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Tailscale offers **logs-only observability** (network flow logs + config audit logs) with **no native visualization**.

**The Gap:** Customers must export logs to **third-party SIEM tools** (Datadog, Splunk, Grafana) or build their own dashboards, creating friction and fragmented experiences.

**The Opportunity:** Legacy VPNs and modern cloud networking platforms provide **built-in dashboards and analytics**. Tailscale's community is **building 4+ observability tools** to fill this gap.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Build **"Tailscale Insights"** - a native observability platform that provides:
- Real-time network flow visualization
- Device health monitoring
- ACL policy visualization
- Audit logging and compliance reports
- Alerting and anomaly detection

**Business Case:**
- **New revenue stream:** $5-10/device/month add-on = $500K-1M ARR potential
- **Enterprise table stakes:** Can't sell Enterprise without observability
- **Competitive differentiation:** No competitor (Cloudflare, Twingate, ZeroTier) has integrated observability
- **Community validation:** 4+ community projects prove demand

---

## Current State: Tailscale Observability (October 2025)

### What Tailscale Provides

#### 1. Network Flow Logs (Premium/Enterprise only)

**What they capture:**
- Source and destination device (Tailscale IPs)
- Traffic volume (bytes sent/received)
- Protocols and ports
- Timestamps (connection start/end)
- Virtual traffic type (DERP relay vs direct connection)

**What they DON'T capture:**
- ❌ Packet contents (encrypted, privacy-first design)
- ❌ Application-level details (HTTP URLs, SQL queries, etc.)
- ❌ User actions within applications
- ❌ Performance metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss)

**Availability:**
- Premium plan: Network flow logs available
- Enterprise plan: Network flow log streaming to SIEM

**Access method:**
- API only (no web UI visualization)
- Must export to SIEM for analysis

**Limitations:**
- Must be manually enabled (not on by default)
- IPv6 endpoints only for streaming (no IPv4 due to CGNAT)
- No retention policy documented (appears to be short-term)
- No built-in dashboard or visualization

---

#### 2. Configuration Audit Logs (All plans)

**What they capture:**
- Administrative actions (ACL changes, user adds/removes, device approvals)
- Actor (who made the change)
- Target resource (what was changed)
- Timestamp

**Availability:**
- All plans: 90 days retention in admin console
- Personal/Personal Plus/Enterprise: Can stream to SIEM

**Access method:**
- Admin console: Basic log viewer (text list)
- API: Programmatic access
- SIEM streaming: Export to third-party tools

**Limitations:**
- No visualization of change patterns
- No impact analysis ("What will this ACL change affect?")

---

#### 4. ACL Policy Management

**What you can do:**
- Edit ACL policy file (JSON/HuJSON format)
- Preview rules (see what user X can access)
- Test ACL changes (unit tests in policy file)
- View which rule grants access to destination

**Capabilities:**
- ACL preview: "Show me what alice@company.com can access"
- Policy testing framework (write tests to prevent breaking changes)
- Line-by-line rule attribution

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No visual graph of ACL relationships
- ❌ No impact analysis ("If I add this rule, who gets new access?")
- ❌ No simulation mode ("What if I changed this rule?")
- ❌ No conflict detection (overlapping or contradictory rules)
- ❌ No usage analytics ("Is anyone actually using this rule?")
- ❌ Text-based editing only (no GUI policy builder)

---

   - No packet loss / jitter measurement

4. **Alerting & Notifications**
   - No alerts on anomalies (unusual traffic, new device, etc.)
   - No integration with PagerDuty, Slack, etc.
   - No proactive warnings (device offline, certificate expiring, etc.)

5. **Compliance & Reporting**
   - No pre-built compliance reports (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
   - No executive summary dashboards
   - No export to PDF/CSV for auditors

6. **User Experience Monitoring**
   - No end-user perspective (what's the experience for alice@company.com?)
   - No application-level insights (which apps are slow over Tailscale?)
   - No troubleshooting workflows ("Why can't I connect to X?")

---

### How Customers Monitor Tailscale Today

**Based on available options, customers use:**

#### Option 1: Export to SIEM (Enterprise customers)

**Flow:**
1. Enable network flow logs in Tailscale admin console
2. Configure log streaming to SIEM (Datadog, Splunk, Axiom, etc.)
3. Build custom dashboards in SIEM tool
4. Set up alerts and reports

**Tools used:**
- **Datadog:** Official integration, pre-built dashboards
- **Splunk:** Via log streaming, custom queries required
- **Axiom:** Emerging integration, simpler than Splunk
- **Elasticsearch/Logstash:** Open-source alternative
- **S3 + Athena:** Log to S3, query with AWS Athena

**Pros:**
✅ Comprehensive tooling (alerting, dashboards, ML anomaly detection)
✅ Centralized logging (Tailscale + application logs in one place)
✅ Enterprise-grade retention and compliance features

**Cons:**
❌ **Expensive:** $50-500/month for SIEM (Datadog, Splunk)
❌ **Complex setup:** Requires expertise in SIEM tool
❌ **Tailscale-specific customization:** Must build Tailscale dashboards from scratch
❌ **Not accessible to SMB:** Too expensive and complex for small teams

---

#### Option 2: Use Community Tools (Tech-savvy customers)

**Community projects identified:**
- **TSFlow:** Real-time network traffic flow visualization
- **tailscale-healthcheck:** Python Flask app for device health monitoring
- **Network Topology Mapper:** Visual interface for ACL rules
- **Custom scripts:** API polling + Prometheus/Grafana

**Pros:**
✅ Free and open source
✅ Purpose-built for Tailscale
✅ Lightweight (can run on tailnet itself)

**Cons:**
❌ **Fragmented:** Each tool solves one problem, no unified view
❌ **Unsupported:** Community-maintained, no SLA
❌ **Limited adoption:** Each tool has <100 users
❌ **Setup required:** Not plug-and-play

---

#### Option 3: Manual Monitoring (SMB/Free tier customers)

**What they do:**
- Check admin console periodically (device list, logs)
- Use `tailscale ping` CLI to test connectivity
- Review audit logs after incidents
- No proactive monitoring

**Pros:**
✅ Free (included in all plans)
✅ No additional tools required

**Cons:**
❌ **Reactive only:** No alerts, discover problems when users complain
❌ **Limited visibility:** No traffic analytics, no trends
❌ **Time-consuming:** Manual checking doesn't scale

---

### Pain Points (What Customers Complain About)

**From support tickets, community forums, and GitHub issues:**

1. **"I can't see who's accessing what in real-time"**
   - Network flow logs are API-only, no dashboard
   - Must export to SIEM to visualize
   - Friction for incident response

2. **"ACL policies are hard to understand and debug"**
   - JSON/HuJSON editing is error-prone
   - Preview mode is limited (one user at a time)
   - No visual representation of "who can access what"

3. **"I need compliance reports for auditors"**
   - Must build custom reports from logs
   - No pre-built SOC2/HIPAA templates
   - Exporting logs to PDF/CSV is manual

4. **"I don't know when devices go offline"**
   - No alerting (must poll admin console)
   - Offline devices stay in list indefinitely
   - No health monitoring (is device struggling?)

5. **"Setting up Datadog/Splunk is overkill for my small team"**
   - $50-500/month is expensive for 10-50 person company
   - Requires SIEM expertise (don't have it)
   - Want simple, built-in monitoring

- Get tunnel status, user lists, bandwidth stats
- Used by third-party monitoring tools (SolarWinds NPM, etc.)

---

#### 4. Third-Party Integration (Required for Advanced Features)

**Common pattern:**
- Native PAN-OS monitoring is basic
- Enterprises forward logs to Splunk, Graylog, or other SIEM
- Build custom dashboards for GlobalProtect
- "Firewall's reporting capabilities leave quite a bit to be desired" (community quote)

**Observation:** Even legacy VPN vendors rely on SIEM for advanced observability

---

### Common Patterns in Legacy VPN Monitoring

| Feature | Cisco AnyConnect | Palo Alto GlobalProtect | Tailscale |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Native Dashboard** | ✅ VPN Summary | ✅ ACC / GlobalProtect Activity | ❌ None |
| **Real-time Metrics** | ✅ Active users, bandwidth | ✅ Connection count, auth status | ❌ Must use API |
| **User Geolocation** | ✅ Map view | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ None |
| **Device Health** | ✅ Client version, OS | ✅ Client version, OS | ⚠️ Basic (version only) |
| **Traffic Analytics** | ✅ NetFlow + CESA | ⚠️ Via SIEM | ⚠️ Via SIEM (logs only) |
| **Alerting** | ✅ Via SNMP traps | ✅ Via SIEM | ❌ None |
| **SIEM Integration** | ✅ Splunk (CESA) | ✅ Splunk, Graylog | ✅ Datadog, Splunk, Axiom |
| **Historical Reports** | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Via SIEM | ❌ Must build in SIEM |

**Key Takeaway:** Legacy VPNs provide **basic native dashboards** + **SIEM export for advanced use cases**. Tailscale provides **SIEM export only**, no native dashboards.

## Modern Cloud Networking Observability

### AWS VPC Flow Logs (Cloud Networking Standard)

**What it is:**
- Network traffic logging for AWS VPCs
- Captures IP traffic to/from network interfaces
- Industry standard for cloud networking visibility

**Data captured:**
- Source/destination IPs
- Ports and protocols
- Packet and byte counts
- Accept/reject decisions (security group rules)
- Flow direction (ingress/egress)

**Publish destinations:**
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Real-time streaming, query with CloudWatch Insights
- **S3:** Long-term storage, query with Athena
- **Kinesis Data Firehose:** Stream to third-party tools

**Key features:**
- ✅ **No performance impact:** Collected outside data path
- ✅ **Scalable:** Handles millions of flows per second
- ✅ **Queryable:** CloudWatch Insights, Athena SQL queries
- ✅ **Alertable:** CloudWatch alarms on flow patterns
- ✅ **Visualizable:** CloudWatch dashboards, third-party tools

**Observability patterns:**
1. **Real-time monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards with flow metrics
2. **Anomaly detection:** CloudWatch Contributor Insights (top talkers, unusual patterns)
3. **Security analysis:** Query for suspicious traffic (port scans, data exfiltration)
4. **Compliance:** Long-term retention in S3 for audit

**Pricing model:**
- $0.50 per GB of flow logs captured
- Additional costs for CloudWatch/S3 storage
- Can get expensive at scale (customers filter what to log)

---

### Cloudflare Zero Trust Analytics (Modern ZTNA)

**What it provides:**
- **Native dashboard** in Cloudflare One console
- **Access Analytics:** Authentication activity, login trends
- **Gateway Analytics:** DNS/HTTP/network traffic
- **Shadow IT Discovery:** Unsanctioned SaaS usage

**Access Analytics Dashboard (New in 2025):**

**Available filters:**
- Logins granted/denied
- Access events by type (SSO, Login, Logout)
- Application name (Salesforce, Jira, Slack)
- Identity provider (Okta, Google, Microsoft)
- Countries and source IPs
- App type (self-hosted, Infrastructure, RDP)

**Apply multiple filters:**
- Example: "Show me failed logins from China to Salesforce app via Okta"
- Dive into specific slices of Access metrics

**Visualization:**
- Time-series charts (logins over time, spot spikes)
- Geographic maps (where are users connecting from)
- Application usage breakdown (top apps by logins)
- Authentication method distribution (SSO vs one-time PIN)

---

**Log Explorer & Custom Dashboards (2025):**

**Features:**
- Query logs from Zero Trust suite (Access, Gateway, etc.)
- Create custom dashboards for specific use cases
- Monitor suspicious activity (unusual countries, failed logins)
- Save queries and share dashboards

**Pricing:** Free during Q2 2025, pricing TBD later

---

**Key differentiator:** Cloudflare provides **built-in analytics UI** without requiring third-party SIEM.

**Observation:** This is what Tailscale customers want but don't have.

---

### Service Mesh Observability: Istio & Linkerd (Modern Microservices)

**Why this matters:** Tailscale's bridge strategy includes Service Mesh Lite (see Community Projects Analysis)

**Istio Observability:**

**Four Golden Signals:**
1. **Latency:** Request duration (p50, p99, max)
2. **Traffic:** Requests per second
3. **Errors:** HTTP error rates (4xx, 5xx)
4. **Saturation:** Resource utilization (CPU, memory)

**Default integrations:**
- **Prometheus:** Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana:** Pre-built dashboards for service mesh health
- **Kiali:** Service graph visualization, topology, traffic flow
- **Jaeger:** Distributed tracing (request path through services)

**Out-of-the-box dashboards:**
- Service mesh overview (request rates, latency, errors)
- Service-to-service communication graph
- Workload performance (per-service metrics)
- Control plane health (Istio components)

---

**Linkerd Observability:**

**linkerd-viz component:**
- Web dashboard for service mesh visibility
- Pre-configured Grafana dashboards
- Real-time metrics (request rate, latency, success rate)
- Service topology graph

**Metrics exposed:**
- Request-level metrics (HTTP/gRPC)
- Service-to-service golden metrics
- TCP connection stats (for non-HTTP traffic)
- Prometheus-compatible (scrape and export)

**Key insight:** Service meshes provide **observability by default**. You install Linkerd, you get dashboards. No extra setup.

---

**Parallel to Tailscale:**

| Aspect | Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd) | Tailscale (Current) | Tailscale (Opportunity) |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Service-to-service connectivity | Device-to-device connectivity | Both (with Services) |
| **Observability** | Built-in dashboards (Grafana, Kiali) | Export to SIEM only | Could have built-in dashboards |
| **Metrics** | Request rate, latency, errors | Network flows only | Could add connection quality metrics |
| **Topology Viz** | Service graph (who talks to who) | ❌ None | ACL visualization |
| **Alerting** | Prometheus alerts out-of-box | ❌ None | Could build on top of metrics |

**Lesson:** Modern networking tools (service mesh, cloud networking) **include observability as core feature**, not an afterthought.

---

   - **Gap: No alerting system**

3. **"Understand our usage for budgeting"**
   - Want: How many devices, how much traffic, who's active
   - Current: Must export logs and analyze
   - **Gap: No usage reports**

---

## Observability Strategy: Lessons from Competitors

### Strategy 1: Native Dashboard + SIEM Export (Hybrid Approach)

**Who does this:** Cisco AnyConnect, Palo Alto GlobalProtect, AWS

**How it works:**
- Provide **basic native dashboard** for common use cases (90% of customers)
- Provide **SIEM export** for advanced/enterprise customers (10% of customers)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ SMB/mid-market gets observability without SIEM cost
- ✅ Enterprise gets deep integration with existing tools
- ✅ Product differentiates on built-in capabilities

**Tailscale parallel:**
- Build "Tailscale Insights" (native dashboard) for Team tier
- Keep SIEM export for Enterprise tier
- Best of both worlds

---

### Strategy 2: All-In on Native Platform (Cloudflare Approach)

**Who does this:** Cloudflare Zero Trust, modern SaaS platforms

**How it works:**
- Comprehensive **built-in analytics** (no SIEM required)
- Custom dashboards, saved queries, alerting all native
- SIEM export available but not primary

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simpler for customers (one tool, not two)
- ✅ Faster time-to-value (no SIEM setup)
- ✅ Differentiation (better UX than competitors)

**Drawbacks:**
- ⚠️ Must build sophisticated analytics platform (high eng cost)
- ⚠️ May not satisfy customers with existing SIEM investment

**Tailscale parallel:**
- Cloudflare-style Insights could differentiate from Twingate/ZeroTier
- But Tailscale has smaller eng team than Cloudflare
- Hybrid approach (Strategy 1) is more realistic

---

### Strategy 3: Open Ecosystem (Service Mesh Approach)

**Who does this:** Istio, Linkerd

**How it works:**
- Expose **Prometheus metrics** (standard format)
- Provide **reference dashboards** (Grafana JSON)
- Let ecosystem build on top (Kiali, Jaeger, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Leverages existing tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
- ✅ Community extends platform
- ✅ Lower eng investment than building from scratch

**Drawbacks:**
- ⚠️ Requires customers to run Prometheus/Grafana (ops burden)
- ⚠️ Fragmented ecosystem (many tools, no unified UX)

**Tailscale parallel:**
- Already doing this (export to Datadog, Splunk, etc.)
- Community built tools (TSFlow, healthcheck) extend Tailscale
- **But fragmentation is the problem, not the solution**

---

## Strategic Recommendation: Build "Tailscale Insights"

### Vision: Observability as Core Feature, Not Afterthought

**Positioning:** "Tailscale is the only VPN with built-in observability. No SIEM required."

---

### Tailscale Insights: Product Definition

#### Feature Set (MVP)

**1. Network Flow Dashboard**

**Real-time view:**
- Live network traffic (who → who, bytes/sec)
- Active connections (count, duration)
- Top talkers (devices with most traffic)
- Geographic view (where is traffic flowing)

**Historical view:**
- Traffic trends (last 7/30/90 days)
- Bandwidth usage per device/user
- Connection patterns (when is tailnet busiest?)

**Technology:**
- Query network flow logs (already collected)
- Aggregate and visualize in web UI
- WebSocket for real-time updates

---

**2. Device Health Monitoring**

**Per-device metrics:**
- Online/offline status (current + history)
- Connection quality (direct vs DERP relay %)
- Last seen timestamp
- Tailscale client version (highlight outdated)
- Operating system

**Fleet-wide metrics:**
- Total devices (online/offline/total)
- Client version distribution (how many on v1.50, v1.52, etc.)
- Connection quality distribution (% direct, % DERP)
- Geographic distribution (devices by region)

**Alerts:**
- Device went offline (email, Slack, webhook)
- Device on outdated version (security risk)
- Multiple devices offline (incident?)

---

**3. ACL Policy Visualization**

**Visual graph:**
- Node-link diagram (users/groups → devices/services)
- Show which ACL rule grants access
- Color-code by access level (full, limited, denied)

**"Who can access what" explorer:**
- Search: "Show me who can access database-prod"
- Result: List of users/groups + ACL rules granting access

**Impact analysis:**
- "What if I add this rule?" (show new access grants)
- "What if I remove this rule?" (show broken access)

**Conflict detection:**
- Overlapping rules (Rule A and Rule B both grant access)
- Contradictory rules (Rule A allows, Rule B denies)

**Usage analytics:**
- Which ACL rules are actively used (based on flow logs)
- Which rules are unused (consider cleanup)

---

**4. Audit Log Viewer (Enhanced)**

**Current:** Basic text list of config changes

**Enhanced:**
- **Timeline view:** Visualize changes over time
- **Change impact:** "This ACL change affected 15 users"
- **Actor profile:** "alice@company.com made 23 changes this month"
- **Correlation:** Link config changes to traffic changes

**Compliance reports:**
- Pre-built templates (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI)
- Export to PDF/CSV for auditors
- Scheduled reports (monthly summary to compliance team)

---

**5. Alerting & Notifications**

**Alert types:**
- Device health (offline, outdated version)
- Security (new device, ACL change, unusual traffic)
- Performance (high bandwidth usage, connection quality drop)
- Compliance (config change without approval)

**Alert channels:**
- Email
- Slack
- Webhook (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, custom)
- In-app notifications

**Alert rules:**
- Pre-defined (device offline, new device approved)
- Custom (traffic to X exceeds Y GB/day)

---

### Tailscale Insights: Architecture

**Data sources:**
1. **Network flow logs** (already collected)
2. **Configuration audit logs** (already collected)

---

### Tailscale Insights: Business Case

**Revenue opportunity:**

**Scenario 1: 10% of customers adopt Insights Premium**
- Current Team/Premium/Enterprise customers: ~10,000 companies (estimate)
- 10% adoption = 1,000 companies
- Average 100 devices per company
- $5/device/month × 100 devices = $500/month per customer
- **1,000 × $500 = $500K/month = $6M ARR**

**Scenario 2: Insights included in pricing refresh**
- New "Team" tier ($100/month, includes basic Insights)
- 50% of customers upgrade to Premium Insights ($5/device add-on)
- Insights becomes revenue driver for tier upgrades
- **Additional $3-5M ARR from tier upgrades**

**Total opportunity:** $5-10M ARR from Insights (conservative)

---

**Competitive impact:**

**Win deals based on Insights:**
- "Tailscale has built-in observability, Twingate requires Datadog ($500/month extra)"
- Saves customer $6K-10K/year on SIEM costs
- Easier to approve purchase (one tool, not two)

**Reduce churn:**
- Observability = visibility = trust
- Customers who can see their network are less likely to churn
- **Hypothesis:** 5-10% reduction in churn = $1-2M ARR retained

**Enterprise expansion:**
- Observability is table stakes for Enterprise deals
- Currently losing deals: "No dashboard, must use Datadog" (friction)
- With Insights: Competitive with Cloudflare on observability

---

**Cost to build:**

**Engineering investment:**
- 2 full-time engineers × 6 months = ~$500K loaded cost
- Ongoing: 1 engineer for maintenance/features = ~$200K/year

**Infrastructure cost:**
- Time-series database (Prometheus/InfluxDB): ~$5K/month ($60K/year)
- Storage (S3/similar): ~$2K/month ($24K/year)
- **Total: ~$84K/year infrastructure**

**Payback period:**
- $500K build cost + $84K/year infra = ~$600K year 1
- $6M ARR / $600K cost = **10x ROI in year 1**
- Breakeven in ~2 months of sales

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Build vs Buy (Should we partner with SIEM instead?)

**Risk:** Building observability platform is significant eng investment. Could we partner with Datadog/Grafana instead?

**Mitigation:**
- **Hybrid approach:** Build basic Insights (Level 3), maintain SIEM export for advanced (Level 5)
- **Leverage existing:** Use Prometheus/Grafana as backend (open source)
- **Differentiation:** Native Insights is competitive advantage (Cloudflare proves this)

**Decision:** Build core Insights, partner for advanced analytics

---

### Risk 2: Customer Adoption (Will customers use it?)

**Risk:** Customers are happy with SIEM export, don't adopt native Insights

**Evidence against:**
- Community built 4+ observability tools (proves unmet demand)
- SMB customers say "Datadog is too expensive" (need cheaper option)
- Cloudflare Insights has high engagement (proof that native analytics work)

**Mitigation:**
- Design partner program (validate before building)
- Include Insights in base tier (not optional, default ON)
- Educate customers (blog posts, webinars on how to use Insights)

---

### Risk 3: Competitive Response (Twingate, ZeroTier copy us)

**Risk:** Competitors see Insights, build their own

**Response:**
- **Speed:** First mover advantage (9-12 month lead)
- **Quality:** Make Insights best-in-class (not just first)
- **Integration:** Deep integration with Tailscale (ACL viz, device health)

**Observation:** Twingate, ZeroTier haven't built this yet (despite being around for years). They're focused on other areas.

---

### Risk 4: Scope Creep (Becomes Datadog competitor)

**Risk:** Try to build full observability platform, never ship

**Mitigation:**
- **MVP discipline:** Ship Phase 1 (basic dashboard) in 3 months
- **80/20 rule:** Build 20% of features that solve 80% of problems
- **Partner for advanced:** SIEM export for customers who need more

**Focus:** Tailscale-specific observability (network flows, ACLs, devices). Don't try to be general-purpose monitoring tool.

---

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Current State Summary

**Tailscale today:**
- ❌ No native dashboard (Level 1: Logs only)
- ✅ SIEM export (Datadog, Splunk, Axiom)
- ⚠️ Community built 4+ tools to fill gap

**Competitors:**
- ✅ Cloudflare: Level 4 (Advanced native analytics)
- ✅ Cisco/Palo Alto: Level 3 (Basic native dashboards + SIEM)
- ✅ AWS VPC: Level 4 (CloudWatch dashboards + analytics)

**The gap:** Tailscale is 2-3 levels behind on observability maturity

---

- Deep analytics require specialized tools (Datadog, Splunk)
- Tailscale shouldn't try to be full SIEM

**What:**
- Keep existing integrations (Datadog, Splunk, Axiom, S3)
- Improve documentation (reference dashboards, best practices)
- Partner with SIEMs (co-marketing, certified integrations)

**Position:** "Built-in Insights for 90% of use cases, SIEM export for advanced 10%"

---

#### 3. Consolidate Community Observability Projects 🤝

**Why:**
- Fragmented tools create poor UX
- Community shouldn't own core features
- Productizing community innovation builds trust

**What:**
- Engage with community tool authors (TSFlow, healthcheck, topology mapper)
- Incorporate best ideas into Tailscale Insights
- Recognize community contributions (blog posts, case studies)
- Deprecate redundant tools gracefully (offer migration to Insights)

**Messaging:** "We listened to the community and built what you asked for"

---

#### 4. Differentiate on Observability in Marketing 📢

**Why:**
- Competitors (Twingate, ZeroTier) don't have native analytics
- Cloudflare does, but at higher price point ($7/user vs Tailscale's device-based)

**Messaging:**
- "Tailscale Insights: The only VPN with built-in observability"
- "No SIEM required. See your network in real-time."
- "Save $6K-10K/year on Datadog/Splunk costs"

**Channels:**
- Product launch blog post
- Comparison pages (vs Cloudflare, Twingate)
- Sales enablement (demo Insights in every call)

---

### Success Metrics

**Product metrics:**
- 50% of Premium/Enterprise customers activate Insights (Month 6)
- 80% of Insights users log in weekly (engagement)
- NPS increase of +10 points attributed to Insights

**Business metrics:**
- $1M ARR from Insights add-on (Year 1)
- $5M ARR from Insights add-on (Year 2)
- 5% reduction in churn (customers with Insights vs without)
- 10% increase in Enterprise win rate (Insights as differentiator)

**Competitive metrics:**
- Insights mentioned in 50% of competitive win stories
- "Built-in observability" featured in 3+ analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)

---

### Final Thought

**"You can't manage what you can't measure."**

Tailscale provides great connectivity. But without observability, customers are flying blind. They don't know:
- Who's accessing what
- Is the network healthy?
- Are we secure?
- Should we expand or optimize?

**Insights makes the invisible visible.** And visibility drives trust, expansion, and retention.

**Competitors are ahead on this. Tailscale needs to catch up, then leapfrog.**

# Summary

**By David Crawshaw** - The foundational post that articulated Tailscale's philosophy and vision.

**How it was**: Crawshaw began programming in 1990s above his parents' medical practice with 15 PCs running MS-DOS, initially using "IPX over coax to a Novell Netware server" before transitioning to Windows NT and TCP/IP.

**The childhood magic**: Describes LANs as "a magical place to learn about computers," offering freedoms impossible on modern internet infrastructure. Could experiment with "permission-less file sharing, experimental servers with no security" without affecting anyone beyond the building. Hardware felt manageable: "A 200MHz Pentium Pro felt blazing fast and 32MB of RAM could do anything."

**The small business magic**: Crawshaw's father (a GP) built medical record software using Clipper database on the LAN. This non-programmer created productivity gains by optimizing workflows, reducing staff needs beyond commercial alternatives. "My father made more money as a part-time programmer optimizing his small business than he did as a doctor."

**How it is**: Modern technology offers superior capabilities but higher barriers. Security requirements like "Learning how to store passwords or add OAuth2" are deterrents. His father would likely purchase cloud solutions today, sacrificing custom development productivity gains.

**A dream: How it will be**: Envisions recreating 1990s LAN experiences using modern infrastructure. Combining WireGuard VPN with identity services to establish "a virtual 90s-style LAN made up of all your 21st century devices."

Five core properties:
- Global identity systems with cryptographic IP-level authorization
- Automatic key generation and rotation
- Unspoofable IP-to-person mapping
- Custom servers with limited access
- Data protection through "social dynamics of small groups"

**Conclusion**: "We are going to rebuild the LANs (and BBSs and MUDs) of the 90s as a world of mesh networks on top of today's internet."

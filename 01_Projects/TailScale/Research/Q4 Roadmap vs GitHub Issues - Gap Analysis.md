---

## Detailed Pain Point Mapping

### 1. DNS & Custom Domain Management ‚úÖ WELL COVERED

**GitHub Issues:**
- #1543 - Custom DNS Records (highest engagement)
- #4221 - Custom Domains for MagicDNS
- #11563 - Custom Domains for Funnel
- #7081 - TLS Wildcard Certificates

**Q4 Roadmap Items:**

| Item | Priority | Stage | Team | Driver | Status |
|------|----------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| **MagicDNS names** | P3 | GA | Networking | Kabir Sikand | Problem doc done, 1-pager in progress |
| **Bring your own domain** | P2 | Alpha | Networking | Kabir Sikand | Not started |
| **SplitDNS rule configuration** | P2 | Beta | Networking | Kabir Sikand | Problem doc done, 1-pager done |

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Strong Q4 focus on DNS customization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "MagicDNS names" is only P3 despite being #1 GitHub issue
- ‚úÖ Multiple approaches (custom records, BYOD, split rules)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation incomplete for BYOD (not started)

**Coverage: 90%** - Well addressed but priority misalignment

---

### 2. Multi-Tailnet Access ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

**GitHub Issue:**
- #183 - Multiple Tailnets Simultaneously (276+ reactions, 52 comments)
- Priority: P3 "Can't get started"
- Impact: L4 "Most users"
- **CRITICAL:** "Blocks enterprise adoption and partnerships"

**Q4 Roadmap Items:**

| Item | Priority | Stage | Team | Driver | Commit | Status |
|------|----------|-------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Multiple IdP and domain support for MT alpha** | P1 | Stretch/Alpha | Identity | Sam Linville | Stretch | Not started |
| **Tailnet access policies for MT alpha** | P2 | Alpha | Identity | Sam Linville | No | Not started |
| **Tailnet sharing (peering)** | P0 | (none) | GM | Sam Linville | No | Unstaffed by PM |

**Analysis:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-tenancy (MT) != Multi-tailnet access
  - MT allows one org to manage multiple networks
  - Users want to connect to multiple networks simultaneously
- ‚ùì "Tailnet sharing (peering)" might address this but is **unstaffed by PM**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è P0 item with no PM staffing is a red flag
- ‚ùå Original GitHub issue may not be fully addressed

**Coverage: 40%** - Related work, but not the same problem

**Critical Question:** Does "Tailnet sharing" solve #183, or is this organizational multi-tenancy only?

---

### 3. Local Network Route Optimization ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**GitHub Issue:**
- #1227 - Bypass Relay with Local Routes (88+ reactions, 155+ comments)
- Priority: P3 "Can't get started"

## Questions for Product Leadership

1. **Multi-tailnet vs Multi-tenancy:**
   - Does "Tailnet sharing (peering)" solve the GitHub #183 issue?
   - Why is this P0 item unstaffed by PM?

2. **Mobile Strategy:**
   - Why no Q4 items for mobile battery optimization?
   - Is this deferred to Q1 or deprioritized?

3. **Priority Alignment:**
   - MagicDNS names is #1 GitHub issue but P3 in Q4 - why?
   - What's the philosophy on community feedback vs roadmap?

4. **Local Network Features:**
   - mDNS and Wake-on-LAN have high demand but no roadmap items
   - Is there a strategic reason (architecture, complexity)?

5. **Coverage Gaps:**
   - Are the 40% of unaddressed pain points intentionally deferred?
   - What's the plan for closing these gaps?

---

## Conclusion

The Q4 roadmap shows **strong alignment** with customer pain points in DNS/networking and routing optimization. However, **critical gaps exist** in mobile optimization and true multi-tailnet access.

**Strongest Alignment:**
- DNS customization (3 dedicated items)
- Self-serve enterprise features
- Routing intelligence improvements

**Biggest Risks:**
- Multi-tailnet access may not be truly solved
- Mobile battery drain completely unaddressed
- Popular features (mDNS, WoL) not planned

**Strategic Recommendation:** Consider adding at least one mobile optimization item to Q4 or early Q1, and clarify the multi-tailnet strategy urgently given its enterprise blocking status.

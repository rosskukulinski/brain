# Pricing and Packaging Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Current Model:** Tailscale uses a hybrid per-user + per-device pricing model across consumer and business tiers. This analysis examines competitive positioning and identifies opportunities for device-based pricing optimization.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Competitive Positioning:** Tailscale's Premium tier ($18/user) matches ZeroTier Essential ($18/month for 10 devices) but offers better value for teams with fewer devices per user
2. **Device Pricing Advantage:** $0.50/device add-on is 75-87% cheaper than competitors ($1.50-$2.00/device)
3. **Strategic Gap:** No mid-market tier between Starter ($6/user) and Premium ($18/user) - 3x price jump
4. **Recommendation:** Introduce device-based pricing tier to capture platform use cases where device count >> user count

## Competitive Analysis

### Pricing Model Comparison

| Vendor | Model | Free Tier | Entry Business | Mid Tier | Add-On Device Cost |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Tailscale** | Hybrid (user + device) | 3 users, 100 devices | $6/user | $18/user | **$0.50/device** |
| **ZeroTier** | Flat + per-device | 10 devices | $18/month (10 devices) | $250/month (125 devices) | $2.00/device (Essential)<br>$1.50-$1.85/device (Premium) |
| **Twingate** | Per-user only | 5 users | $5/user | $10/user | N/A (no device model) |

### Tailscale's Pricing Advantages

**1. Device Pricing is 75-87% Cheaper**
- Tailscale: $0.50/device
- ZeroTier Essential: $2.00/device (4x higher)
- ZeroTier Premium: $1.50/device at scale (3x higher)
- Twingate: No device-based option

**2. Free Tier Better for Small Teams**
- Tailscale: 3 users, 100 devices (great for small team with lots of devices)
- ZeroTier: 10 devices, 1 admin (better for single user, many devices)
- Twingate: 5 users (limited for testing infrastructure)

**3. Premium Features at Competitive Price**
- Tailscale Premium: $18/user/month (full ACLs, SSH, Funnel, audit logs)
- ZeroTier Essential: $18/month flat (10 devices, comparable features)
- Twingate Business: ~$10/user/month (unclear feature parity)

### Tailscale's Pricing Disadvantages

**1. No Pure Device-Based Tier**
- **Problem:** Platform use cases (server-to-server, IoT, service mesh) don't map to "users"
- **Workaround:** Use add-on devices ($0.50 each), but still requires base user tier
- **Competitor advantage:** ZeroTier Premium is pure device model ($250 for 125 devices = $2/device)

**2. Large Price Jump: Starter → Premium**
- **Gap:** $6/user → $18/user (3x increase)
- **Missing tier:** No option between $6-$18 for teams that need more than basic ACLs but not full enterprise features
- **Risk:** Customers stay on Starter longer, delay Premium upgrade

**3. Enterprise Pricing Opacity**
- **Problem:** "Contact sales" with no indicative pricing
- **Competitor comparison:** ZeroTier shows Premium at $250/month (125 devices), clear path to scale
- **PLG friction:** Lack of self-serve pricing at scale contradicts product-led growth motion

**4. User-Based Model Penalizes Platform Adoption**
- **Scenario:** CI/CD pipeline with 100 build agents, 5 human operators
- **Tailscale cost:** 5 users × $18 = $90 + 100 devices × $0.50 = $50 = **$140/month**
- **ZeroTier cost:** Essential $18 + 90 devices × $2 = $198/month OR Premium $250/month (better value)
- **Issue:** Still anchored to "user" concept when workload identity is the real need

---

## Market Segmentation by Pricing Model

### Segment 1: VPN Customers (Human → Resource)
**Characteristics:**
- More users than devices (1:1 to 1:3 ratio)
- Access to internal resources (databases, admin panels, etc.)
- Security and access control primary concerns
- Audit logging, SSO, compliance requirements

**Optimal Pricing Model:** Per-user
- Tailscale Premium: $18/user/month ✅
- Add-on devices at $0.50 for phones, tablets, personal devices

**Competitive Position:** **Strong**
- Full ACLs, SSH, Funnel, audit logging at $18/user competitive
- Device add-ons cheap relative to competitors
- Enterprise tier for large deployments with custom needs

### Segment 2: Platform Users (Resource → Resource)
**Characteristics:**
- Many devices, few users (1:10 to 1:100 ratio)
- Service mesh, multi-cloud connectivity, CI/CD, IoT
- Workload identity, not human identity
- Performance and reliability primary concerns

**Optimal Pricing Model:** Per-device
- Tailscale: No pure device tier ❌
- Workaround: Starter $6 base + $0.50/device/month
- Example: 1 user + 100 devices = $6 + $50 = $56/month

**Competitive Position:** **Mixed**
- Device pricing ($0.50) is excellent vs ZeroTier ($1.50-$2.00)
- BUT: Still requires user anchor, complicates billing for workload-only deployments
- ZeroTier Premium ($250 for 125 devices) is simpler for pure infrastructure use

### Segment 3: Hybrid Customers (Both Use Cases)
**Characteristics:**
- VPN use case: Engineers accessing production infrastructure
- Platform use case: Kubernetes clusters, microservices, CI/CD
- 20-50 users, 200-1000 devices
- Highest LTV segment (130-150%+ NRR)

**Optimal Pricing Model:** Hybrid (user + device)
- Tailscale Premium: $18/user + $0.50/device ✅
- Example: 30 users, 500 devices = $540 + $250 = $790/month

**Competitive Position:** **Very Strong**
- User-based model captures VPN value
- Device add-ons cheap for infrastructure expansion
- Single platform, unified billing
- Competitors require two separate products

---

## Device-Based Pricing Recommendation

### Proposed New Tier: "Platform"

**Pricing:** $100/month base + $1/device/month

**Included:**
- Base: 100 devices
- Additional: $1/device/month (volume discounts at 500+, 1000+)
- Unlimited service accounts / workload identities
- Full ACLs (device-to-device policies)
- API access for automation
- Audit logging (device activity)

**Excluded:**
- No user SSO/SCIM (not needed for infrastructure)
- No Tailscale SSH (device-to-device only)
- No Funnel (server workloads don't need inbound from internet)

**Target Customers:**
- Kubernetes clusters
- CI/CD pipelines
- IoT deployments
- Multi-cloud infrastructure
- Service mesh replacements

**Why This Works:**

1. **Aligns with COGS:** Device count drives coordination service costs (not user count)
2. **Captures Platform Market:** Pure infrastructure buyers don't map to "users"
3. **Competitive Positioning:** $1/device at scale beats ZeroTier ($1.50-$2.00) but captures more value than $0.50 add-on
4. **Upsell Path:** Platform customers who add VPN use case upgrade to Premium (hybrid pricing)
5. **PLG Friendly:** Self-serve pricing, clear value prop, no sales call required

### Pricing Examples: Platform Tier

| Devices | Monthly Cost | Per-Device Cost | ZeroTier Equivalent | Savings |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| 100 | $100 | $1.00 | $18 + $180 = $198 (Essential) | 49% |
| 125 | $125 | $1.00 | $250 (Premium) | 50% |
| 500 | $450* | $0.90 | $250 + $562.50 = $812.50 | 45% |
| 1000 | $800* | $0.80 | $250 + $1,537.50 = $1,787.50 | 55% |

*Assuming volume discounts: 100-499 devices = $1.00, 500-999 = $0.90, 1000+ = $0.80

### Migration Path: Current Add-On → Platform Tier

**Scenario:** Customer starts on Starter, adds devices over time

**Current Model:**
- Month 1: Starter ($6) + 50 devices ($25) = $31/month
- Month 6: Starter ($6) + 200 devices ($100) = $106/month ← **Should upgrade to Platform tier**
- Month 12: Starter ($6) + 500 devices ($250) = $256/month

**Proposed with Platform Tier:**
- Month 1-5: Starter ($6) + 50 devices ($25) = $31/month (stay on Starter)
- Month 6: Upgrade to Platform ($100 base + 100 devices included, + 100 extra = $100) = $100/month ← **Saves $6**
- Month 12: Platform ($100 + 400 devices @ $0.90 = $360) = $460/month ← **Saves $50/month vs workaround**

**Customer Benefit:** Clearer pricing, better value at scale, no "user" fiction for workload identity

**Tailscale Benefit:**
- Captures more value than $0.50/device add-on
- Clarifies positioning (VPN vs Platform)
- Reduces sales friction (no explaining "just create a fake user for your servers")

---

## Hybrid Pricing Model Refinement

### Current Problem: User Definition Ambiguity

**Question:** "What is a user?"
- Is it a human?
- Is it a service account?
- Is it a Kubernetes cluster?
- Is it a CI/CD pipeline?

**Current Workaround:** "Create a user for your infrastructure, add devices as needed"

**Problem with Workaround:**
- Confusing billing ("why am I paying for a user that's not a person?")
- Arbitrary mapping (is 1 K8s cluster = 1 user? Or 1 per namespace?)
- Doesn't align with actual usage (workload identity ≠ user identity)

### Proposed: Two Distinct Billing Models

**Model A: User + Device (VPN Use Case)**
- Tiers: Starter, Premium, Enterprise
- Pricing: $6-$18/user + $0.50/device
- Use case: Humans accessing resources
- Includes: ACLs, SSH, Funnel, audit logs

**Model B: Device-Only (Platform Use Case)**
- Tier: Platform
- Pricing: $100/month base (100 devices) + $1/device beyond
- Use case: Resources accessing resources
- Includes: Device ACLs, API access, audit logs
- Excludes: User SSO, SSH, Funnel

**Hybrid Customers:** Use both models
- Example: 30 engineers (Premium @ $18) + 500 infrastructure devices (Platform tier) = $540 + $460 = $1,000/month
- Unified billing, separate line items
- Clear value prop for each use case

---

## Enterprise Pricing Transparency

### Current State: Opacity

**What We Know:**
- Enterprise tier is "custom pricing"
- Negotiated discounts: 30-39% off list (from procurement data)
- Includes advanced features: Tailnet Lock, posture management, dedicated support

**What We Don't Know:**
- List price for enterprise tier
- Device limits or pricing structure
- Minimum commit requirements
- Multi-year discount structure

### Recommendation: Indicative Enterprise Pricing

**Why Transparency Helps PLG:**
1. **Reduces sales friction:** Buyers can self-qualify
2. **Sets expectations:** Avoids sticker shock in sales calls
3. **Encourages faster growth:** Customers plan for scale in advance
4. **Competitive positioning:** ZeroTier shows Premium tier pricing ($250/month for 125 devices)

**Proposed:** Show starting point on pricing page

Example:
> **Enterprise**
> Starting at $500/month for custom deployments
> - Custom device limits
> - Advanced posture management
> - Tailnet Lock
> - Dedicated support
> - Priority response SLAs
> - [Contact Sales for quote]

**Benefits:**
- Still requires sales call (preserves enterprise motion)
- Gives buyers ballpark for budgeting
- Signals "this is for serious deployments" (filters out tire-kickers)

---

## Pricing Psychology & Anchoring

### Current Anchor Points

**Free → Paid Conversion:**
- Personal (Free): $0
- Personal Plus: $5/month ← **First paid tier, extremely low friction**
- Starter: $6/user/month ← **Minimal jump from Personal Plus**

**Small Team → Business Conversion:**
- Starter: $6/user/month
- Premium: $18/user/month ← **3x jump, significant friction**

**SMB → Enterprise Conversion:**
- Premium: $18/user/month (predictable)
- Enterprise: "Contact sales" ← **Unknown pricing, high friction**

### Problem: Missing Middle

**Gap:** Starter ($6) → Premium ($18) is a 3x increase

**Customer Pain Point:**
- "We need better ACLs than Starter (autogroups aren't enough)"
- "But we don't need SSH, Funnel, MDM policies, or full audit logging"
- "Why pay 3x for features we won't use?"

**Result:** Customers delay Premium upgrade, use workarounds (external SSH, manually managed firewall rules)

### Proposed: "Professional" Tier

**Pricing:** $10/user/month

**Features:**
- Full ACLs (custom groups, individual user policies)
- 90-day audit logging (vs 30-day in Starter, 1-year in Premium)
- API access (for automation)
- Basic Tailscale SSH (no recording/session logs)

**Positioning:**
- **Starter:** Teams that need basic network access
- **Professional:** Teams that need access control, some automation ← **NEW**
- **Premium:** Teams with compliance, security, advanced needs
- **Enterprise:** Custom deployments, dedicated support

**Value Ladder:**
- $6 → $10 → $18 (1.67x increases, more psychologically acceptable)
- Gives customers a "stepping stone" tier
- Captures value from teams that need ACLs but not full Premium feature set

---

## Revenue Impact Model

### Assumptions
- 1000 customers across all tiers
- Customer distribution: 40% Starter, 30% Premium, 20% Enterprise, 10% Free/Personal
- Average team size: 15 users
- Average devices per user: 1.5 (humans) or 10:1 (platform use cases)

### Current Revenue Model

**Starter Customers (400 teams × 15 users):**
- 400 × 15 users × $6 = $36,000/month

**Premium Customers (300 teams × 15 users):**
- 300 × 15 users × $18 = $81,000/month

**Enterprise Customers (200 teams × 30 users avg):**
- Assume $25/user (after discount): 200 × 30 × $25 = $150,000/month

**Device Add-Ons (Starter + Premium, assume 20% buy add-ons, avg 50 devices):**
- 700 × 0.20 × 50 × $0.50 = $3,500/month

**Total:** $270,500/month = **$3.25M ARR**

### Proposed Revenue Model (with Platform + Professional tiers)

**Starter Customers (300 teams, down from 400 due to Platform tier):**
- 300 × 15 users × $6 = $27,000/month

**Professional Customers (150 teams, new tier):**
- 150 × 15 users × $10 = $22,500/month

**Premium Customers (250 teams, down from 300 due to Professional cannibalization):**
- 250 × 15 users × $18 = $67,500/month

**Platform Customers (100 teams, new tier, avg 300 devices):**
- 100 × ($100 base + 200 devices × $1) = 100 × $300 = $30,000/month

**Enterprise Customers (200 teams, unchanged):**
- 200 × 30 × $25 = $150,000/month

**Device Add-Ons (reduced due to Platform tier):**
- 500 × 0.20 × 50 × $0.50 = $2,500/month

**Total:** $299,500/month = **$3.59M ARR**

**Net Impact:** +$110K ARR (+3.4%) from better tier segmentation

**Key Assumptions:**
- 100 teams migrate from Starter to Platform tier (infrastructure-heavy users)
- 150 teams upgrade from Starter to Professional (need better ACLs)
- 50 teams stay on Premium (full features justified)
- Minimal enterprise cannibalization (enterprises need custom features)

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research & Validation (Month 1-2)

**Customer Interviews:**
- **Starter customers:** Why not Premium? What features would justify $10/user?
- **Premium customers:** Which features do you actually use? Would you downgrade to $10 for subset?
- **Enterprise customers:** How did you decide on custom pricing? What would make self-serve viable?
- **Churned customers:** Why did you leave? Was pricing a factor?

**Data Analysis:**
- Feature usage by tier (what % of Premium customers use SSH, Funnel, etc.?)
- Device-to-user ratios by customer segment
- Upgrade velocity: Starter → Premium (how long does it take?)
- Add-on device usage: what % of customers buy add-ons? At what quantity?

**Competitive Intelligence:**
- Win/loss analysis: when do we lose to ZeroTier/Twingate on pricing?
- Migration case studies: what pricing drove decisions?

### Phase 2: Pricing Model Design (Month 2-3)

**Finalize Tier Structure:**
- Confirm Professional tier pricing ($10/user) and features
- Confirm Platform tier pricing ($100 base + $1/device) and features
- Define volume discounts for Platform (500+, 1000+ devices)
- Design hybrid billing for customers using both VPN + Platform

**Packaging Decisions:**
- What moves from Premium → Professional? (e.g., basic SSH, 90-day logs)
- What stays Premium-exclusive? (e.g., Funnel, MDM, 1-year+ logs)
- What's included in Platform? (e.g., device ACLs, API access)
- What's excluded from Platform? (e.g., user SSO, SSH, Funnel)

**Grandfather Policy:**
- Existing customers: keep current pricing, or opt-in to new tiers
- Existing add-on device customers: migrate to Platform tier? Incentive?

### Phase 3: Pricing Page Redesign (Month 3-4)

**New Layout:**
- Two product lines: "Tailscale VPN" (user-based) and "Tailscale Platform" (device-based)
- Clear use case differentiation: human access vs infrastructure connectivity
- Side-by-side comparison: Starter, Professional, Premium, Enterprise (VPN) + Platform (devices)
- Calculator widget: "How much will Tailscale cost?" (input users + devices → output price)

**Messaging:**
- "Secure access for humans" (VPN tiers)
- "Zero-trust networking for infrastructure" (Platform tier)
- "Best of both" (hybrid customers)

**CTAs:**
- VPN tiers: "Start free trial" (14 days)
- Platform tier: "Start free trial" (14 days)
- Enterprise: "Contact sales" + indicative pricing ("Starting at $500/month")

### Phase 4: Beta Launch (Month 4-6)

**Target Customers:**
- 50 existing Starter customers with high device counts → invite to Platform tier beta
- 50 existing Premium customers with low feature usage → invite to Professional tier beta
- 25 new signups → A/B test new pricing page vs old

**Metrics to Track:**
- Conversion rates: Free → Starter/Professional/Premium/Platform
- Upgrade rates: Starter → Professional → Premium
- Migration rates: Starter + devices → Platform
- Revenue per customer (by segment)
- NPS by tier

**Feedback Collection:**
- Weekly calls with beta customers
- In-app survey: "Does this pricing make sense?"
- Sales team feedback: easier or harder to close deals?

### Phase 5: Full Launch (Month 6+)

**Rollout:**
- Announce new tiers publicly (blog post, email campaign)
- Update docs with new tier explanations
- Train sales team on positioning
- Update marketing site, comparison pages, sales decks

**Monitoring:**
- Weekly dashboard review: conversions, upgrades, churn by tier
- Monthly pricing review meeting
- Quarterly customer interviews to validate pricing fit

**Iteration:**
- Adjust tier pricing based on data (e.g., is $10 too high/low for Professional?)
- Refine feature allocation (e.g., should Funnel be in Professional or stay Premium?)
- Optimize hybrid billing for VPN + Platform customers

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Premium Cannibalization

**Risk:** Professional tier at $10/user cannibalizes Premium ($18/user)
- Customers downgrade to Professional, Tailscale loses revenue

**Mitigation:**
- Make Professional feature set clearly limited (basic SSH, 90-day logs)
- Emphasize Premium value (compliance, audit logs, MDM, Funnel)
- Offer discounted Premium upgrade for Professional customers (e.g., $15/user if you upgrade in first 6 months)
- Grandfather existing Premium customers at current price

**Metric to Watch:** Premium → Professional downgrades. If >10% of Premium customers downgrade, re-evaluate Professional feature set.

### Risk 2: Platform Tier Too Cheap

**Risk:** $1/device undervalues infrastructure use case
- Customers get multi-Gbps WireGuard performance for $1/device/month
- Coordination service costs scale with device count

**Mitigation:**
- Start with $1/device, monitor gross margins by cohort
- Introduce volume discounts ($0.90 at 500+, $0.80 at 1000+) to signal "scale costs less" but preserve revenue
- Upsell to Platform+ tier ($1.50/device) with premium features (e.g., multi-region DERP, priority bandwidth)
- If margins suffer, adjust to $1.25-$1.50/device in year 2

**Metric to Watch:** COGS per Platform customer vs revenue. Target: <30% COGS ratio (coordination + DERP + support).

### Risk 3: Complexity Hurts PLG Motion

**Risk:** Two product lines (VPN vs Platform) confuse buyers
- "Which tier do I need? I have humans AND infrastructure."
- Customers churn during decision paralysis

**Mitigation:**
- Simple decision tree on pricing page: "Do you need human access to resources? → VPN tiers. Do you need infrastructure connectivity? → Platform tier. Need both? → Use hybrid pricing."
- Calculator widget: Input users + devices, outputs recommended tier + price
- Sales team training: qualify customers quickly, recommend tier in first call
- Clear documentation: use cases, examples, migration guides

**Metric to Watch:** Free trial → paid conversion rate. If conversion drops post-launch, pricing complexity may be the cause.

### Risk 4: Enterprise Customers Delay Upgrades

**Risk:** Indicative enterprise pricing ($500/month starting) anchors too high
- Customers stay on Premium ($18/user × 50 users = $900/month) instead of contacting sales
- Enterprises self-select out due to perceived high cost

**Mitigation:**
- Test messaging: "Starting at $500/month" vs "Custom pricing for 100+ users"
- Offer white-glove migration for Premium → Enterprise (free professional services)
- Create "Enterprise Lite" tier: $25/user for 50-100 users (no dedicated support, but gets Tailnet Lock, posture management)
- Track Enterprise inbound leads: if volume drops post-pricing transparency, revert to "Contact sales" only

**Metric to Watch:** Premium → Enterprise upgrade rate. Target: 20% of 50+ user Premium customers contact sales within 12 months.

## Summary & Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Tailscale's current pricing is competitive for VPN use cases** (human → resource), but **lacks a device-based tier for Platform use cases** (resource → resource)

2. **$0.50/device add-on is 75-87% cheaper than competitors**, but **requires a user-based tier anchor** which doesn't align with infrastructure workloads

3. **3x price jump from Starter ($6) → Premium ($18) creates friction** for customers who need better ACLs but not full Premium features

4. **Enterprise pricing opacity** ("contact sales") contradicts PLG motion and creates uncertainty for buyers planning future growth

### Top 3 Recommendations

**1. Introduce Platform Tier: $100/month base (100 devices) + $1/device**
- **Why:** Captures infrastructure market (K8s, CI/CD, IoT) without forcing "user" fiction
- **Impact:** +100 Platform customers × $300/month avg = +$360K ARR
- **Timeline:** 4-6 month beta, full launch month 6

**2. Add Professional Tier: $10/user/month with full ACLs + basic SSH**
- **Why:** Fills gap between Starter ($6) and Premium ($18), reduces upgrade friction
- **Impact:** 150 upgrades from Starter × $60/month = +$108K ARR
- **Timeline:** Launch alongside Platform tier (month 4-6)

**3. Add Indicative Enterprise Pricing: "Starting at $500/month"**
- **Why:** Reduces sales friction, helps customers self-qualify, sets expectations
- **Impact:** Faster enterprise deals (fewer "surprise" pricing objections), better lead quality
- **Timeline:** Quick win, can implement month 1-2 (just copy change)

### Combined Revenue Impact

**Current ARR (modeled):** $3.25M
**Proposed ARR (with new tiers):** $3.59M
**Net Increase:** +$340K ARR (+10.5%)

**Assumptions:**
- 100 new Platform customers (infrastructure-heavy)
- 150 Starter → Professional upgrades
- 50 Premium → Professional downgrades (cannibalization)
- Minimal enterprise impact (custom pricing unaffected)

### Next Steps

1. **Customer research** (Month 1): Interview 30 customers across Starter, Premium, Enterprise, and churned segments
2. **Data analysis** (Month 1): Feature usage, device-to-user ratios, upgrade velocity
3. **Pricing model finalization** (Month 2): Confirm Professional + Platform tier structure
4. **Beta launch** (Month 4): 125 customers test new tiers
5. **Full launch** (Month 6): Public rollout with updated pricing page, blog post, sales enablement

## Appendix: Pricing Calculator Examples

### Example 1: Small Team (VPN Use Case)

**Profile:**
- 10 engineers
- Each has 2 devices (laptop + phone)
- Need full ACLs for security compliance

**Current Pricing:**
- Premium: 10 users × $18 = $180/month
- Devices included: 10 users × 20 devices = 200 devices (enough)
- **Total: $180/month**

**Proposed Pricing (with Professional tier):**
- Professional: 10 users × $10 = $100/month ← **Better value**
- Devices included: 10 users × 15 devices = 150 devices (enough)
- **Total: $100/month**
- **Savings: $80/month (44%)**

### Example 2: Infrastructure-Heavy Team (Platform Use Case)

**Profile:**
- 5 DevOps engineers (human access)
- 200 servers, containers, Kubernetes nodes (infrastructure)

**Current Pricing:**
- Starter: 5 users × $6 = $30/month
- Add-on devices: 200 × $0.50 = $100/month
- **Total: $130/month**

**Proposed Pricing (with Platform tier):**
- Platform: $100 base (100 devices) + 100 devices × $1 = $200/month
- **Total: $200/month**
- **Cost Increase: $70/month** ← BUT: clearer pricing, better positioning, more value captured

**Alternative (if they need human VPN access too):**
- Starter: 5 users × $6 = $30/month (for human access)
- Platform: $100 + 100 devices × $1 = $200/month (for infrastructure)
- **Total: $230/month**
- **Increase: $100/month** ← Captures full value of hybrid use case

### Example 3: Hybrid Customer (VPN + Platform)

**Profile:**
- 30 engineers (need VPN access to production)
- 500 servers (Kubernetes, microservices, databases)
- Need full ACLs, audit logging, compliance features

**Current Pricing:**
- Premium: 30 users × $18 = $540/month
- Add-on devices: 500 × $0.50 = $250/month
- **Total: $790/month**

**Proposed Pricing:**
- Premium: 30 users × $18 = $540/month (VPN use case)
- Platform: $100 + 400 devices × $0.90 (volume discount) = $460/month (infrastructure)
- **Total: $1,000/month**
- **Increase: $210/month (27%)** ← Captures more value, but still competitive

**Competitive Comparison (ZeroTier):**
- Premium tier: $250 (125 devices) + 375 devices × $1.70 = $887.50
- Plus: Need separate VPN solution for human access (e.g., $10/user × 30 = $300)
- **ZeroTier Total: $1,187.50/month**
- **Tailscale Advantage: $187.50/month savings (16%)**

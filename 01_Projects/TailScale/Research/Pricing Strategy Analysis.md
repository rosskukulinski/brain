## Industry Trends: Consumption-Based Pricing

### Macro Trends (2025 Data)

**1. Widespread Adoption**
- **85% of SaaS companies** have usage-based pricing (UBP) or are implementing it
- **77% of largest software companies** incorporate consumption-based pricing
- **Growth:** Usage-based pricing adoption increased **31% since 2023**
- **Pure subscription models declining:** 65% → 43% from 2023 to 2025

**2. Hybrid Models Winning**
- Companies with **hybrid models** (subscription + usage) report **21% median growth**
- Outperforms pure subscription and pure usage models
- Best of both worlds: Predictable base + scales with value

**3. Infrastructure Leading Adoption**
- **IaaS and PaaS adopting faster** than application SaaS
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) all use consumption pricing
- Aligns with variable workloads, dynamic infrastructure

**4. AI/Automation Driving Change**
- AI spending surged **75.2% year-over-year**
- AI/automation reduces human users (fewer seats needed)
- "The more successful the product, the fewer user seats needed"
- Forces shift from per-seat to per-outcome/per-usage

### Relevant Use Cases for Consumption Pricing

**From industry research:**

✅ **Device-based:** IoT services, security monitoring, network management
- Price per: vehicles, cameras, sensors, hosts, servers, network devices

✅ **Usage-based:** Variable workloads, dynamic infrastructure
- Price per: API calls, data transfer, compute hours, active connections

✅ **Outcome-based:** Automation that replaces human work
- Price per: transaction, automation run, model inference

**Tailscale use cases that fit:**
- IoT/edge device management (hundreds of sensors/devices)

## Evaluation of Thesis

### Thesis 1: Simplify to ~3 Plans

**Current state:** 5 tiers (Personal, Personal Plus, Starter, Premium, Enterprise)

**Competitive benchmark:**
- Cloudflare: 3 tiers ✅
- NetBird: 3 tiers ✅
- Zscaler: 3-4 tiers ✅
- Twingate: 4 tiers
- ZeroTier: 4 tiers

**Industry best practice:** 3-4 tiers maximum for B2B SaaS

**Customer feedback signals:**
- Complexity increases time-to-decision
- Comparison paralysis ("which tier do I need?")
- Hard to predict costs (user + device math)
- Sales friction (need demo to understand pricing)

**Verdict: ✅ STRONGLY SUPPORT**

**Recommended consolidation:**

| Proposed Tier | Current Mapping | Target Customer | Price Point |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Free** | Personal | Individuals, hobbyists | $0 |
| **Team** | Personal Plus + Starter + Premium | Small/medium businesses | $8-12/unit |
| **Enterprise** | Enterprise | Large orgs, compliance needs | Custom |

**Rationale:**
1. **Eliminate "Personal Plus"** - Small tier between free and paid creates confusion. Either free or paid.
2. **Consolidate Starter + Premium** - The only major difference is "full ACLs" vs "limited ACLs". This should be a feature toggle, not a pricing tier.
3. **Keep Enterprise separate** - Custom pricing, dedicated support, compliance features warrant separate tier.

**Result:** 3 clear tiers, easier to understand, faster purchase decisions.

---

### Thesis 2: Index on Devices, Not Users

**Current state:** Primarily user-based ($6-18/user/month) with device add-ons ($0.50/device)

**Argument FOR device-based pricing:**

1. **Aligns with actual value delivered**
   - Customer gets value from each connected device
   - More devices = more network, more connectivity value
   - IoT/edge use cases are device-heavy, user-light

2. **Better matches infrastructure use cases**
   - CI/CD runners (100 ephemeral runners, 5 engineers)
   - K8s pods (200 pods, 10 platform engineers)
   - IoT deployments (1000 sensors, 2 operators)
   - AI agents (500 agents, 20 AI engineers)

3. **Reduces optimization burden**
   - Current model: "Should I share a user account across devices to save money?"
   - Gaming the system with service accounts
   - Device-based: Just connect what you need

4. **Competitive validation**
   - ZeroTier (direct competitor) is pure device-based
   - Twingate went "unlimited devices per user" to remove anxiety
   - Signals that device counting is problematic

5. **Market positioning**
   - Device-based differentiates from Zero Trust platforms (Cloudflare, Zscaler = user-based)
   - Aligns Tailscale with infrastructure/IoT, not just VPN replacement

**Argument AGAINST device-based pricing:**

1. **User-based is SaaS norm**
   - Sales teams understand it
   - Procurement expects it
   - Easier to comp shop ("$10/user vs $7/user")

2. **Seats proxy for company size**
   - 10 users = small company, 1000 users = large company
   - Pricing tiers scale naturally
   - Devices can be misleading (1 person with 50 devices vs 50 people with 1 device each)

3. **Revenue capture in team settings**
   - If company has 100 employees all using Tailscale from 1 device each...
   - User-based: 100 × $10 = $1,000/month ✅
   - Device-based at $2/device: 100 × $2 = $200/month ❌ (leaves money on table)

4. **Identity is tied to users**
   - SSO, ACLs, audit logs all reference users
   - Device-only pricing decouples from identity story
   - "Who did this?" matters, devices are just endpoints

**Hybrid approach (current model):**

❌ **Worst of both worlds:**
- Complex to understand
- Hard to predict cost
- Creates optimization burden ("How do I minimize both users AND devices?")
- Adds cognitive load to purchase decision

**Verdict: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL SUPPORT - Depends on target market**

**Recommended approach: "Devices with user-based packaging"**

Instead of pure device-based or pure user-based, consider:

**Option A: Simplified Hybrid (Device Pools by User Tier)**
- Small Team: 50 devices included, $10/month flat
- Team: 200 devices included, $50/month flat
- Enterprise: Unlimited devices, $X per 100 devices or custom

**Option B: Device-First with User Context**
- Primary metric: Devices ($2-3/device/month)
- User seats included: "Up to 1 user per 5 devices included"
- Additional users: $5/user/month if needed
- Example: 100 devices = $200/month, includes 20 users

**Option C: Segmented Pricing by Use Case**
- **Team Edition:** User-based (VPN replacement, access control)
  - $10/user/month, unlimited devices per user
  - Target: SaaS companies, remote teams
- **Infrastructure Edition:** Device-based (IoT, K8s, edge)
  - $2/device/month, unlimited users
  - Target: Platform engineers, IoT deployments

**Recommendation:** **Option C (Segmented)** or **Option A (Simplified Hybrid)**
- Allows capturing both team/VPN use case (user-based) and infrastructure use case (device-based)
- Clear positioning: "Are you connecting people or machines?"

---

### Thesis 3: Explore Consumption-Based Pricing

**Current state:** Subscription model (pay upfront for capacity)

**Industry trends:**
- **85% adoption** of usage-based pricing in SaaS
- **31% growth** in usage-based models since 2023
- **Hybrid models (subscription + usage) showing 21% median growth**
- Infrastructure companies leading adoption

**What "consumption-based" could mean for Tailscale:**

#### Option 1: Active Device Hours
- **Metric:** Device-hours connected per month
- **Pricing:** $0.01/device/hour (example)
- **Example:** 100 devices connected 24/7 = 72,000 device-hours = $720/month
- **Benefit:** Pay only for what's actively connected
- **Drawback:** Unpredictable billing, complex metering

#### Option 2: Data Transfer / Bandwidth
- **Metric:** GB transferred over Tailscale network per month
- **Pricing:** $0.10/GB (example)
- **Example:** 1TB transferred = $100/month
- **Benefit:** Aligns with actual network usage
- **Drawback:** Customers hate bandwidth billing (see cloud egress fees)

#### Option 3: Active Connections
- **Metric:** Number of unique device-to-device connections per month
- **Pricing:** $0.001/connection (example)
- **Example:** 10,000 connections = $10/month
- **Benefit:** Reflects network complexity
- **Drawback:** Hard to predict, opaque

#### Option 4: Hybrid Subscription + Overages
- **Base subscription:** Includes X devices or Y device-hours
- **Overage pricing:** $Z per device/hour over base
- **Example:**
  - Team plan: $100/month, includes 1,000 device-hours
  - Overage: $0.02/device-hour beyond 1,000
  - Month with 1,500 device-hours: $100 + (500 × $0.02) = $110
- **Benefit:** Predictable base + flexibility for spikes
- **Drawback:** Still requires metering, adds complexity

#### Option 5: Tiered Consumption Buckets
- **Pricing tiers based on consumption levels:**
  - **Starter:** Up to 500 device-hours/month = $50/month
  - **Growth:** Up to 5,000 device-hours/month = $300/month
  - **Scale:** Up to 50,000 device-hours/month = $2,000/month
  - **Enterprise:** Custom
- **Benefit:** Predictable (pre-pay for bucket), simple
- **Drawback:** Still need to estimate usage upfront

**Verdict: ✅ SUPPORT - But with Hybrid Model (Subscription + Usage)**

**Recommended approach:**

**"Base Subscription + Consumption Overages"** (Option 4 variant)

**Pricing structure:**
- **Base tier:** Flat monthly fee includes N devices (e.g., $50/month for 50 devices)
- **Pay-as-you-go devices:** Additional devices at $1/device/month
- **Active-only billing:** Only pay for devices that connected during the month
- **Annual commit discount:** Pre-pay annual, get 15-20% off

**Example:**

| Tier | Monthly Base | Included Devices | Overage Rate | Target Customer |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Team** | $50 | 50 | $1/device | Small teams, <100 devices |
| **Growth** | $200 | 250 | $0.80/device | Growing companies |
| **Enterprise** | $1,000+ | 1,000+ | $0.50/device | Large deployments |

**Billing scenario:**
- Company on **Team plan** ($50/month, 50 devices included)
- Month 1: Connected 45 devices → Billed $50 (under limit)
- Month 2: Connected 75 devices → Billed $50 + (25 × $1) = $75
- Month 3: Connected 50 devices → Billed $50

**Benefits:**
✅ Predictable base cost (budget-friendly)
✅ Scales with actual usage (fair pricing)
✅ No penalty for temporary spikes (pay only when used)
✅ Aligns with industry trends (hybrid subscription + usage)
✅ Works for both steady-state and dynamic workloads

**Risks to mitigate:**
⚠️ Metering accuracy (ensure device tracking is bulletproof)
⚠️ Bill shock (notify customers approaching overage)
⚠️ Complexity (need clear billing dashboard, invoices)

### Revenue Impact Summary

**Winners (more revenue):**
✅ Infrastructure-heavy deployments (IoT, K8s, edge)
✅ Low-user, high-device scenarios
✅ Current Starter tier customers with many devices

**Losers (less revenue):**
❌ User-heavy, device-light deployments (VPN replacement)
❌ Current Premium tier customers

**Mitigation:**
- For user-heavy deployments, could add **optional user-based pricing**
  - Example: "Team plan $100/month OR $8/user/month (whichever is greater)"
  - Captures both device-heavy and user-heavy customers

**Alternative Pricing:**

**Proposed V2: Dual Metric (Devices OR Users)**

- **Team Plan:** $100/month OR $8/user/month, whichever is greater
  - Includes: 100 devices OR unlimited users with up to 100 devices total
  - Overages: $1/device beyond 100

**Examples:**
- 50 devices, 5 users → $100/month (base minimum)
- 50 devices, 100 users → $800/month (user-based)
- 200 devices, 20 users → $100 + $100 = $200/month (device-based)

**This captures both markets without leaving revenue on table.**

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Revenue Loss from Migration

**Risk:** Existing customers pay less under new model, net revenue declines.

**Probability:** Medium-High

**Impact:** High (could be -10% to -20% revenue in year 1)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Grandfathering:** Keep existing customers on current pricing for 12-24 months
2. **Discount incentive:** Offer 20% discount forever if they voluntarily migrate early
3. **Enterprise expansion:** Focus growth on infrastructure/device-heavy customers (higher revenue under new model)
4. **Minimum spend:** Add "or $X/user/month, whichever is greater" clause to capture user-heavy customers

**Contingency:**
- If revenue drops >15% in months 1-3 post-migration, pause full rollout and adjust pricing

---

### Risk 2: Customer Confusion During Migration

**Risk:** Customers don't understand new model, create support burden, some churn.

**Probability:** High

**Impact:** Medium (support load spike, 2-5% churn)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Crystal-clear communication:** Multiple touchpoints (email, in-app, docs, webinar)
2. **Personalized examples:** "Here's exactly how your bill changes"
3. **Migration calculator:** Let customers input their usage, see estimated cost
4. **Proactive support:** Reach out to top 100 customers with white-glove migration help
5. **Extended notice:** 6-12 months warning before migration (not 30 days)

**Contingency:**
- Offer 1-on-1 migration calls for high-value customers
- Create video walkthrough of new pricing

---

### Risk 3: Competitive Response

**Risk:** Competitors (Cloudflare, Twingate) match or undercut new pricing.

**Probability:** Low-Medium

**Impact:** Medium (pricing pressure, slower growth)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Differentiate beyond price:** Emphasize performance (peer-to-peer), simplicity, developer UX
2. **Lock-in via integrations:** Deep SSO, SCIM, logging integrations create switching cost
3. **Community moat:** Open source clients, strong devrel, community love
4. **Speed:** Ship features faster than competitors can respond

**Contingency:**
- Be prepared to adjust pricing downward if needed
- Focus on value, not price war

---

### Risk 4: Billing System Complexity

**Risk:** Implementing active-only billing, overages, consumption tracking is technically complex.

**Probability:** Medium

**Impact:** High (delays launch, billing errors, customer frustration)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Start simple:** MVP = monthly active device count, manual overage calculation
2. **Incremental rollout:** Test with small cohort before full launch
3. **Clear invoices:** Detailed line items (base + overages + breakdown)
4. **Self-service dashboard:** Let customers see real-time usage and projected bill
5. **Alerts:** Notify customers when approaching overage thresholds

**Contingency:**
- If billing issues arise, offer credits/refunds generously
- Delay full migration until billing system is bulletproof

---

### Risk 5: Sales Team Resistance

**Risk:** Sales team struggles to sell new pricing, prefers old model, slows deals.

**Probability:** Medium

**Impact:** Medium (slower sales cycles, missed targets)

**Mitigation:**
1. **Early involvement:** Include sales in pricing design process
2. **Training:** Role-play objections, practice new pitch
3. **Tools:** Pricing calculator, ROI deck, competitive comparison
4. **Incentives:** Align comp plan with new pricing (no penalty for lower ASP if volume increases)
5. **Success stories:** Share early wins with new pricing to build confidence

**Contingency:**
- Offer hybrid option temporarily (let sales choose old or new pricing per deal)

---

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Summary of Findings

1. **Tailscale's current pricing is the most complex among competitors**
   - 5 tiers (vs 3-4 for competitors)
   - Hybrid user + device model (unique to Tailscale, complex)
   - Hard to predict costs, cognitive overhead

2. **Industry is moving toward consumption-based pricing**
   - 85% of SaaS companies have usage-based elements
   - Hybrid models (subscription + usage) show strongest growth (21%)
   - Infrastructure companies leading adoption

3. **Device-based pricing aligns with Tailscale's value prop**
   - Infrastructure use cases (IoT, K8s, edge, AI) are device-heavy
   - Competitors (ZeroTier) and alternatives (Twingate's "unlimited devices") validate approach
   - Current hybrid model creates optimization burden for customers

### Final Recommendations

#### ✅ 1. Simplify to 3 Tiers (Strong Support)

**Consolidate:**
- **Free:** Personal tier (up to 20 devices, 3 users)
- **Team:** Merge Personal Plus, Starter, Premium into one tier
- **Enterprise:** Keep separate for custom needs

**Rationale:**
- Reduces complexity, faster purchase decisions
- Industry standard (Cloudflare, NetBird, Zscaler all have 3-4 tiers)
- Eliminates artificial feature gating (limited vs full ACLs)

#### ✅ 2. Device-First Pricing with User Flexibility (Conditional Support)

**Hybrid approach:**
- **Primary metric:** Devices ($1/device/month, active-only)
- **Base tier:** $100/month includes 100 devices
- **User option:** OR $8/user/month for user-heavy deployments (whichever is greater)

**Rationale:**
- Captures both infrastructure (device-heavy) and team (user-heavy) markets
- Aligns with value (connectivity for devices)
- Removes device anxiety for users (vs current user+device hybrid)

#### ✅ 3. Consumption-Friendly Model (Strong Support)

**Hybrid subscription + usage:**
- **Base subscription:** Predictable monthly cost
- **Active-only billing:** Pay only for devices that connected
- **Overages:** $1/device beyond base allowance
- **No surprises:** Clear dashboard showing usage and projected bill

**Rationale:**
- Industry trend (85% adoption, 31% growth)
- Fairness (pay for what you use)
- Scales with customer growth (land-and-expand)
- Works for dynamic workloads (CI/CD, ephemeral agents, seasonal)

### Proposed Pricing (Final)

| Tier | Price | Devices Included | Overage | Users | Features |
|------|-------|------------------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 20 | N/A | 3 | All core features |
| **Team** | $100/month (or $8/user, whichever is greater) | 100 | $1/device | Unlimited | All features (ACLs, SSH, Funnel, SSO, logs) |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 1,000+ | Volume discounts | Unlimited | Team + Tailnet Lock, posture, dedicated support, SLAs |

**Active-only billing:** Only pay for devices that connected during the month.

**Example scenarios:**
- 50 devices, 10 users → $100/month (base minimum)
- 50 devices, 100 users → $800/month (user-based: 100 × $8)
- 200 devices, 20 users → $200/month (device-based: $100 + 100 × $1)
- 1,000 devices, 50 users → Enterprise tier (custom pricing)

### Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Research** | Months 1-2 | Customer analysis, revenue modeling, design partner validation |
| **Phase 2: Design** | Months 3-4 | Finalize pricing, billing system, GTM materials |
| **Phase 3: Soft Launch** | Months 5-6 | New customers only, monitor, iterate |
| **Phase 4: Migration** | Months 7-12 | Existing customer migration with grandfathering |
| **Phase 5: Optimization** | Ongoing | Continuous improvement, expansion |

**Total time to full migration: 12 months**

### Expected Outcomes

**Positive:**
✅ Simplified pricing (easier to understand, faster purchase decisions)
✅ Better infrastructure market positioning (competitive with ZeroTier on device-heavy use cases)
✅ Consumption-aligned billing (fair, scales with customer growth)
✅ Higher revenue from infrastructure customers (+50-100% for device-heavy deployments)
✅ Industry alignment (hybrid subscription + usage is 2025 best practice)

**Risks:**
⚠️ Revenue loss from user-heavy customers (mitigated with user pricing option)
⚠️ Migration complexity (mitigated with grandfathering, clear communication)
⚠️ Competitive response (mitigated with differentiation beyond price)

### Next Steps

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Socialize thesis** with pricing team, finance, sales, product
2. **Customer data analysis:** Segment by device/user ratio, model revenue impact
3. **Design partner recruitment:** 10-20 customers for pricing feedback
4. **Competitive deep-dive:** Interview ZeroTier users, understand device-based adoption

**Decision point (Month 3):**
- Go/No-Go on new pricing based on:
  - Revenue impact model (acceptable risk?)
  - Customer validation (do they like it?)
  - Competitive analysis (differentiated enough?)
  - Engineering feasibility (can we build it?)

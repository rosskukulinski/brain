## Tailscale's Key Differentiators

### 1. Architecture Advantages

**Mesh Network vs Hub-and-Spoke:**
- Traditional VPNs route through central concentrators (bottlenecks)
- Tailscale uses peer-to-peer mesh for direct machine connections
- No VPN endpoints as single points of failure
- Better performance and reliability

**Based on WireGuard:**
- Modern, fast, secure protocol
- Built into Linux kernel
- Significantly faster than alternatives (Tailscale/WireGuard 5-10x faster than Nebula, Tinc)
- Note: Netmaker uses kernel WireGuard (faster), Tailscale uses userspace (still fast, more portable)

### 2. Developer Experience

**Setup & Deployment:**
- Deploy in minutes vs weeks/months for traditional VPNs
- No hardware required (no network switches or gateway servers)
- Single user can start in minutes
- New users onboard in < 1 minute

**Ongoing Management:**
- Well-defined user management schema
- SSO integration
- API-driven access management
- Programmable ACLs
- No manual user provisioning

### 3. Security Model

**Zero Trust, Identity-Based:**
- Single sign-on (SSO) support
- User group-based security policies
- Granular ACLs (more configurable than traditional VPNs)
- No perimeter defense reliance

### 4. Migration Strategy

**Parallel Operation:**
- Can run alongside existing VPN systems
- Migrate services/users incrementally
- Try it out without full commitment
- Phased rollout approach

### 5. Scalability

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Adding devices/users doesn't create bottlenecks
- Distributed architecture
- No central point of congestion

## Detailed Migration Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Corelight (OpenVPN → Tailscale)

**Company:** Corelight - California-based cybersecurity, NDR technology

**Previous Solution:** OpenVPN

**Pain Points:**
- 5-25 work hours per week troubleshooting user connectivity
- Single points of failure (standalone VPN hosts)
- Cumbersome onboarding
- Slow throughput
- Dropped connections
- Poor user experience
- Manual user provisioning overhead
- Built on '90s design mentality for on-prem networks

**Evaluation Process:**
- Narrowed to 3 providers: Tailscale, Teleport, AWS Client VPN
- Louis Gardner (Principal Security Infrastructure Engineer) found Tailscale via Google search for "enterprise-grade WireGuard solutions"
- Impressed by ACL capabilities, API-driven access, organic developer support

**Business Impact - Critical Incident:**
During POC evaluation, Columbus office internet severed by backhoe. Using Tailscale ACLs and API, Louis restored full engineering access in **~10 minutes** — impossible with OpenVPN.

**Results:**
- **>66%** of Corelight employees now using Tailscale
- Eliminated single points of failure
- Use cases: AWS VM access, on-prem infrastructure, Kubernetes management, SSH without public IPs

**Key Quote:**

### 3. Equity Compensation

**Series A:**
- 0.3-0.8% of fully diluted equity
- 0.5-3% for experienced VP Product Management

**Series B:**
- 0.2-0.7% of fully diluted equity

**Series C / Late Stage:**
- 0.2-0.7% typical range

- With 4-year vest and potential exit/IPO upside

## Recommended Talking Points

### Opening the Conversation

"Based on my research of VP Product and Head of Product compensation at Series C unicorns using San Francisco market rates, I'm looking for a package that reflects the strategic nature of building product leadership at Tailscale."

### Discussing Base Salary

"For Head of Product reporting to the CEO at a $1.5B valuation company, market data shows $280K-$350K base. Given my experience with Kong, enterprise infrastructure, and Kubernetes - all directly applicable to Tailscale's product challenges - I believe $350K is appropriate and aligns with your SF compensation philosophy."

### Discussing Equity

"At the Series C stage with a $1.5B valuation, I understand equity grants are typically 0.2-0.5% for VP-level roles. However, as the Head of Product reporting directly to the CEO, this role carries strategic weight. I'm targeting 0.5%, which represents meaningful upside alignment while being fair for the company stage."

### Discussing Bonus

"I'd like to see a 30% target bonus tied to both company performance metrics and product-specific OKRs. This creates strong alignment and is standard for VP-level roles with significant P&L impact."
